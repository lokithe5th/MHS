# Funding Cycle 1

The following Juicebox configuration is proposed for funding cycle 1.

### Start date:
2022/03/09

### End date:
2022/03/31

## Configuration detail
**Target:** 10 ETH
**Discount rate:** 10%
**Reserve rate:** 20%
**Bonding curve rate:** 60%

## Reserve recipients:
- 60% healthsystems.eth
- 40% lourens.eth

## Proposed spending breakdown
The **10 ETH** raised is allocated as follows:
- 3 ETH for @LourensLinde to work full time on the project for 2 months
- 1 ETH for the domain name, healthdao.eth, or other appropriate name
- 2 ETH for open-source accounting for the project
- 3 ETH for legal advice regarding the project structure in founder's home country (RSA)
- 1 ETH for initial web page development

## Notes from founder

The amounts are quite arbitrary and might change in the next funding cycle. The main goal of the first funding cycle is to allow for the initial set up and creation of the DAO and to make sure the legal requirements are done with. It is important to me that an open-source method of accounting is put in place to ensure good financial management. The amounts may seem low to do the accounting and legal requirements, but please keep in mind that the project benefits from the geographical arbitrage of me being in South Africa. An ETH stretches much further here than it would in another part of the world. In addition, we have a a very robust legal and financial system. 

If the project raises less than the required funding in this funding cycle, the priority of spending would be 1) legal, 2) accounting, 3) web page, 4) domain name and 5) founder runway. The project must survive first in order to thrive later, and I will prioritize operational requirements before founder income requirements.

Once the structures are in place the next funding cycle will focus heavily on hiring a smart contract developer. The business and health system logic will likely be handled by me, through Metaverse Health Systems (Pty) Ltd, South Africa, to start off with. I have already started work on the spec and smart contracts for the first part of the MHS Protocol, the First Primitive.
