# METAVERSE HEALTH SYSTEMS
Heal Humanity

## INTRODUCTION
The technology stack available to humanity is constantly growing. But public goods infrastructure is often not the first beneficiary of such advancements. A health system is by necessity distributed and thus requires a multitude of semi-autonomous entities to work in concert to achieve effective health care. Blockchain technology provides a better fit for this public good than the legacy technology stack in current use. Metaverse Health Systems is an open-source project for the development of such digitally native health systems. 

## OVERVIEW
MHS is initialized with the goal to become the open-source blueprints for digitally native health systems based on blockchain technology. Such an undertaking requires a myriad of contributors and the hope is that the project inspires contributions from all sectors of daily life. There is strength in diversity - be it racial, idealogical, professional or any other delta from one to another. We celebrate the differences between people and embrace it as a source of strength; a strength that can only be unearthed when working as one. To accomplish the development of the Metaverse Health Systems a distributed autonomous organization will be established (hereafter referred to as the healthDAO).

The README serves as a broad overview of the project; it will evolve over time.

## PROPOSED VALUES OF healthDAO
- Equality
- Diversity
- Do No Harm
- Do Good
- Self-determination and the Sovereign-self
- Simplicity
- Transparency

### EQUALITY
We are all equal. Equality extends to quantitative and qualitative interpretations. 

### DIVERSITY
Remember: **a person is a person through other people**

### DO NO HARM
[Given an existing problem, it may be better not to do something, or even to do nothing, than to risk causing more harm than good.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere) 

### DO GOOD
[Actions must carry a positive cost-benefit analysis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneficence_(ethics))

### SELF-DETERMINATION and the SOVEREIGN-SELF
[Do not presume to control or influence the self-determination and the sovereignity of any person or entity.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination)

### SIMPLICITY
Simple interactions lead to complex systems. 

### TRANSPARENCY
A public good must be auditable by the public it serves and must, as far as the principle of beneficence allows, be designed with this transparent principle in mind.
