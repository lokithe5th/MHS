# METAVERSE HEALTH SYSTEMS
A personal passion project to establish open source health systems for humanity.

## INTRODUCTION
The technology stack available to humanity is constantly growing. But public goods infrastructure is often not the first beneficiary of such advancements. A health system is by necessity distributed and thus requires a multitude of semi-autonomous entities to work in concert to achieve effective health care. Blockchain technology provides a better fit for this public good than the legacy technology stack in current use. Metaverse Health Systems is an open-source project for the development of such digitally native health systems. 

## OVERVIEW
MHS is initialized with the goal to become the open-source blueprints for digitally native health systems based on blockchain technology. Such an undertaking requires a myriad of contributors and the hope is that the project inspires contributions from all sectors of daily life. There is strength in diversity - be it racial, idealogical, professional or any other delta from one to another. We celebrate the differences between people and embrace it as a source of strength; a strength that can only be unearthed when working as one. To accomplish the development of the Metaverse Health Systems a distributed autonomous organization will eventually be established.

The README serves as a broad overview of the project; it will evolve over time.
