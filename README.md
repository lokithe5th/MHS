Metaverse Health Systems

## INTRODUCTION
The technology stack available to humanity is constantly growing. But public goods infrastructure is often not the first beneficiary of such advancements. A health system is by necessity distributed and thus requires a multitude of semi-autonomous entities to work in concert to achieve effective health care. Blockchain technology provides a better fit for this public good than the legacy technology stack in current use. Metaverse Health Systems is an open-source project for the development of such digitally native health systems.
