# GENESIS PROPOSAL
The start of the project requires the initialization of two foundational components: the healthDAO and the Metaverse Health Systems Protocol. The purpose of this proposal is to outline the proposed steps to allow for the establishment of these components.

Please read the README.md document in the projects [GitHub directory](https://github.com/lokithe5th/MHS)

## From the Founder
As a personal project, healthDAO has had many private and work-in-progress names. By becoming a public project, the healthDAO's vision of improving health systems has become owned by the community. I have personally been moving towards this goal, of designing digitally native health systems, for the last couple of years. It's what inspired me to get an MBA, to dive into crypto and to learn some Solidity. I hope to be working on the healthDAO for the next decade at least. Longer, if I'm honest. This is regardless of funding or the project's growth. If you look for me, you will find me here, grinding away. It will, hopefully, be on a full time basis, but even if the project does not attract enough funding for that, I will still be here. I sincerely hope that I find a few like-minded souls to go on this crazy adventure with me. We live in interesting times and I wish you all the health in the world.

Yours in kindness,

Lourens Linde

## healthDAO
The healthDAO is the distributed autonomous organization tasked with the development, operation and maintenance of the Metaverse Health Systems Protocol. At the time of writing the healthDAO does not yet exist. **Calling something a DAO does not make it a DAO**; the hope is with the release of this project into the public domain that individuals and organizations are inspired to join and contribute to the creation of the healthDAO. 

**The proposal and its implementation/s, and/or any community accepted deviations thereon, will be implemented as the genesis proposal by the member, Lourens Linde, who is hereby voluntarily doxxed and can also be identified, and held accountable, through his Health Professions Council of South Africa registration number, PT0119350. He is a practicing physiotherapist and is bound by the ethical rules placed upon such health professionals in the Republic of South Africa.**

## Metaverse Health Systems Protocol
The MHS protocol is the collective term for blockchain-based protocols which are to be developed, maintained and released, with the assistance of the healthDAO, to create digitally native health systems. The protocol is open-source.

## Proposal Contents
1. Establishment of the healthDAO
2. Initialization roadmap for the healthDAO
3. Formalizing operational matters
4. MHS First Primitive

### 1. Establishment of the healthDAO
As a distributed autonomous organization the healthDAO's presence is online. To this end the following must be done:
- Creation of a healthDAO twitter handle
- Securing the appropriate domain/s
- Creation of a new wallet address for the project.
- Selection of community members for multi-sig responsibilities 
- Creation of a multi-sig for project treasury
- Creation of a Discord server to house the healthDAO
- Creation of a Juicebox project, The healthDAO
- Creation of open-source accounting processes

## 2. Roadmap
**Twitter Account**

[x] Completed on 03/02/2022. [Twitter name](link)

**Domains**: @LourensLinde has secured the following domains:

[x] dao.health
[0] If funds can be raised, healthdao.eth is on OpenSea (last listed at 1 ETH)

**Temporary Wallet**
[0x23116a55062a4D65C96E73bA86d402Fe1c9deA4B](https://etherscan.io/address/0x23116a55062a4D65C96E73bA86d402Fe1c9deA4B)

**Multi-sig**

[0] After the first funding cycle four community members who will act as holders for the DAO multi-sig must be chosen. The time-frame for this is 31 March 2022.
[0] Once the members are selected, the multi-sig wallet must be created and the treasury funds transferred thereto.

**Discord**

[x] The creation of the healthDAO Discord server has been done and can be found [here](#). Please join and feel free to contribute in whatever way you can!

**Juicebox Project**
The Juicebox Protocol is well-suited to allow the DAO to raise funds for it's proposed activities. The easily configurable funding cycle will allow for quick, iterative proposals and developments. 

But the utmost care must be taken in the early stages of the project before the establishment of a multi-sig protected community treasury. 

The following initial configurations have been decided on by the founder:
- Funding target: 10 ETHER
- Funding cycle end: 
- Reserve rate: 10%
- Discount rate: 10%
- Bond curve rate: 60%

The goal of the initial funding cycle is as follows:

**10 ETHER**

- 1 ETHER to be used for purchasing healthdao.eth or other appropriate ENS domain/s
- 1 ETHER for web development, preferably to be paid to a community member
- 3 ETHER to seek legal counsel in founder's home country (RSA) regarding DAO requirements
- 2 ETHER to appoint open-source accountants
- 3 ETHER to allow @LourensLinde to work full-time on the project for 8 weeks 

Please see the Funding Cycle 1 document in the GitHub directory. 

## Formalizing Operational Matters
The Genesis Proposal is subject to amendment by the community, but the operational matters concerning the creation of the healthDAO and the MHS First Primitive will be handled by the founder until the community is able to propose and vote on further steps.

**To this end the following is noted:**
- The domains, social media accounts and wallets are under the control of the founder and will be handed over to the community once the healthDAO has been created.
- The items outlined in the roadmap are the founder's responsibility until such a time when the responsibility can be transferred to the community. 

## MHS First Primitive
The first component required for experimenting with digitally native health systems is for a health professional to be able to prove they are a health professional. The MHS First Primitive must thus solve for identification and verification of health professionals and their credentials through a code-based solution.
